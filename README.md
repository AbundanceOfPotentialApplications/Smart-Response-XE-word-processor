# Smart-Response-XE-word-processor
Text editor for the Smart Response XE pocket computer.

I'm standing on the shoulders of giants here and
using the code from the libraries by bitbank2 and fdufnews
https://github.com/bitbank2/SmartResponseXE
https://github.com/fdufnews/SMART-Response-XE-Low_level
But I had to make some changes, so the library is included.

Also, this project is using a QR code library from ricmoo:
https://github.com/ricmoo/QRCode

A pre-built binary is included for convenience.
